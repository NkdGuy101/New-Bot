Και όμως δεν είναι τρεις παντοδύναμοι, αλλά ένας παντοδύναμος.\n΄Έτσι Θεός είναι ο Πατέρας, Θεός ο Υιός, Θεός το Άγιο Πνεύμα. Και όμως δεν είναι τρεις θεοί, αλλά ένας Θεός.\nΈτσι Κύριος είναι ο Πατήρ, Κύριος ο Υιός, Κύριος το Άγιο Πνεύμα. Και όμως δεν είναι τρεις Κύριοι, αλλά ένας Κύριος.\nΓιατί, όπως μας υποχρεώνει η χριστιανική αλήθεια να αναγνωρίζουμε το κάθε Πρόσωπο να είναι Θεός και Κύριος αφ' εαυτού Του\nΈτσι και η καθολική θρησκεία μας απαγορεύει να λέμε ότι υπάρχουν τρεις Θεοί και Κύριοι.\n\nΟ Πατήρ δεν έχει φτιαχτεί από κανέναν: ούτε έχει δημιουργηθεί, ούτε έχει γεννηθεί.\nΟ Υιός, είναι μόνο του Πατρός. Δεν είναι κτιστός ούτε δημιουργημένος, αλλά γεννημένος.\nΤο Άγιο Πνεύμα είναι του Πατρός και του Υιού. Δεν είναι κτιστό ούτε δημιουργημένο, ούτε γεννημένο, αλλά εκπορευόμενο.\nΈτσι υπάρχει ένας Πατήρ, όχι τρεις Πατέρες. Ένας Υιός, όχι τρεις Υιοί. Ένα Άγιο Πνεύμα, όχι τρία Άγια Πνεύματα.\nΚαι σ' αυτή την Τριάδα κανείς δεν προηγείται και κανείς δεν έπεται, κανείς δεν είναι μεγαλύτερος ή μικρότερος από τον άλλο.\nΑλλά καθ' ολοκληρία τα τρία πρόσωπα είναι συναιώνια και ίσα μεταξύ τους.\nΈτσι ώστε σε όλα τα πράγματα, όπως έχει ειπωθεί παραπάνω, η Μονάδα εν Τριάδι, και η Τριάδα εν Μονάδι πρέπει να λατρεύεται.\nΌποιος θέλει να σωθεί, έτσι πρέπει να σκέπτεται για την Τριάδα.\nΕπιπλέον είναι απαραίτητο για την αιώνια σωτηρία, να πιστεύει σωστά στην ενσάρκωση του Κυρίου μας Ιησού Χριστού.\nΓιατί η ορθή πίστη είναι αυτή που πιστεύουμε και ομολογούμε, ότι ο Κύριός μας Ιησούς Χριστός, Υιός του Θεού, είναι Θεός και άνθρωπος.\nΕίναι Θεός από την ουσία του Πατέρα Του, γεννημένος πριν από τους κόσμους. Και άνθρωπος από την ουσία της μητέρας Του, γεννημένος μέσα στον κόσμο.\nΤέλειος Θεός, τέλειος άνθρωπος. Αποτελούμενος από ψυχή λογική και ανθρώπινη σάρκα.\nΊσος με τον Πατέρα όσον αφορά τη Θεότητα. Κατώτερος απ' τον Πατέρα όσον αφορά την ανθρώπινη φύση Του.\nΌμως παρότι είναι Θεός και άνθρωπος, δεν είναι δύο, αλλά ένας Χριστός.\nΈνας, όχι με μετατροπή της θεότητας σε σάρκα, αλλά με πρόσληψη της ανθρωπότητας από τον Θεό.\nΈνας, ολόκληρος, όχι δια της σύγχυσης των ουσιών της θείας & ανθρώπινης ουσίας, αλλά στην ενότητα του Προσώπου.\nΓιατί όπως η λογική ψυχή και η σάρκα κάνουν έναν άνθρωπο, έτσι ο Θεός και ο Άνθρωπος είναι Ένας Χριστός.\nπου υπέφερε για τη σωτηρία μας. Κατέβηκε στην κόλαση. Την τρίτη μέρα αναστήθηκε από τους νεκρούς.\nΑνελήφθη στους ουρανούς, κάθισε εκ δεξιών του Θεού Πατρός του Παντοδύναμου\nΑπό όπου και θα έρθει να κρίνει ζώντες και νεκρούς.\nΣτην έλευση του οποίου όλοι οι άνθρωποι θα αναστηθούν με τα σώματά τους.\nκαι θα δώσουν λόγο για τα έργα τους.\nΚι αυτοί που έχουν έργα καλά, θα μεταβούν σε αιώνια ζωή, κι αυτοί που έχουν έργα κακά, σε αιώνια κόλαση.\nΑυτή είναι η καθολική πίστη, την οποία αν δεν πιστεύει κανείς ειλικρινά και σταθερά, δεν μπορεί να σωθεί.

Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the universal faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Spirit. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Spirit uncreated. The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Spirit unlimited. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Spirit eternal. And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Spirit Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Spirit is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Spirit Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the universal religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity. Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance [Essence] of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance [Essence] of his Mother, born in the world. Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance [Essence]; but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. This is the universal faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.","storage":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Message"}],"_aliases":["athanasian"]},{"name":"signofthecross","permissions":"NONE","restriction":"1","_id":"DotrQ","actions":[{"channel":"0","varName":"","message":"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
